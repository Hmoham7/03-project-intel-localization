# Project 3: Intel localization
Build an interactive webpage that presents Intel's sustainability goals in a timeline format. Using AI and your knowledge of responsive design, you'll experiment with hover effects, transitions, and layouts to ensure it adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile.

Launch a Codespace to get started! Remember to Commit and Push your project changes to GitHub from Codespaces to prevent losing progress.
The new addition will be to use both bootstrap to restructure layout and use lighthouse with 90% or higher.

Make it work for our global audience. Can you adapt it for right-to-left languages like Arabic? We'd love to share this with our global team. We also need to make sure we implement accessibility best practices, as we take inclusive design very seriously. And could you add a subscription form where users can sign up for our sustainability newsletter?
